## A Bit About Me


I'm interested in filed like Linux(I Use Arch BTW), programming and PCB designing. 


By day, I’m a student , yep i don’t know how to introduce myself TBH.


## What to Expect


This blog will be a reflection of my journey - the insights, challenges, victories, and everything in between. I'll be sharing:

- Thoughts on anything
- My experiences with Linux, Coding
- Practical tips and resources I find helpful
- Personal stories and reflections

## Why "MINAX"?


You might be wondering about my name or the significance behind it. But it’s just minimum + maximum LMAO.
