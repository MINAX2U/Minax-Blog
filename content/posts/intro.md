# Hello, I'm MINAX!


Welcome to my corner of the internet. I created this space to share my thoughts, experiences, with you. Whether you've stumbled upon this blog by chance or you're a friend curious about what I'm up to, I'm happy you read this.


## A Bit About Me


I'm interested in filed like Linux(I Use Arch BTW), programming and PCB designing. 


By day, I’m a student in Chulin High school.


## What to Expect


This blog will be a reflection of my journey - the insights, challenges, victories, and everything in between. I'll be sharing:

- Thoughts on anything
- My experiences with Linux, Coding
- Practical tips and resources I find helpful
- Personal stories and reflections

## Why "MINAX"?


You might be wondering about my name or the significance behind it. But it’s just minimum + maximum LMAO.


## Let's Connect


This blog isn't just about me talking to you. Feel free to reach out through social media, or send me an email. I'd love to hear your thoughts, questions. And make friends.


Thank you for joining me on this journey. I'm excited to see where it takes us!


Warmly,


MINAX
